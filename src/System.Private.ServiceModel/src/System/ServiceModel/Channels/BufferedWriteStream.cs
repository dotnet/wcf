    /// is needed by WCF so the read capability has been removed. This allowed some extra logic to be removed
    /// from the write code path. Also some validation code has been removed as this class is no longer
    /// general purpose and is only used in pre-known scenarios and only called by WCF code. Some validation
    /// checks have been converted to only run on a debug build to allow catching code bugs in other WCF code, 
    /// but not causing release build overhead.
    /// 
    /// One of the design goals here is to prevent the buffer from getting in the way and slowing
    /// down underlying stream accesses when it is not needed.
    /// See a large comment in Write for the details of the write buffer heuristic.
    /// 
    /// This class will never cache more bytes than the max specified buffer size.
    /// However, it may use a temporary buffer of up to twice the size in order to combine several IO operations on
    /// the underlying stream into a single operation. This is because we assume that memory copies are significantly
    /// faster than IO operations on the underlying stream (if this was not true, using buffering is never appropriate).
    /// The max size of this "shadow" buffer is limited as to not allocate it on the LOH.
    /// Shadowing is always transient. Even when using this technique, this class still guarantees that the number of
    /// bytes cached (not yet written to the target stream or not yet consumed by the user) is never larger than the
