##   Description of 'Set_Operation_PR_or_Branch' steps for Windows or Unix   ##
##   Have to determine if the run was triggered as a PR or CI and then set 'Operation' accordingly.   ##
##   (Windows)If 'Operation' is set to "pr" the inline script will set the environment variable 'branchNameorPrId''ghprbPullId' to the PR ID value parsed from the 'Build.SourceBranch' variable.   ##
##   (Windows)The variable 'branchNameorPrId' is then used by the 'sync-pr' script.
##   (Unix)If 'Operation' is set to "pr" the inline script will set the environment variable 'branchNameorPrId' to the id of the executing PR.   ##
##   (Unix)The variable 'branchNameorPrId' is then passed to the 'sync-pr' script.
##   If 'Operation' is set to 'branch' it will determine the branch being used and set the environment variable 'branchNameorPrId' to it.
##   The variable 'branchNameorPrId' is then passed to the 'sync-pr' script.
